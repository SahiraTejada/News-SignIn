        longDesc:"React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.A React application is made of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks."

        longDesc:"CSS animation is a feature of CSS that allows you to animate a change in one or more style properties of an element, as well as control various aspects of the animation. Pure CSS animations require no additional code (e.g. JavaScript) or media (e.g. GIFs) — everything is done with HTML and CSS.CSS animations are great for websites that want to add dynamic, engaging content without placing much more weight on the page. Since they don’t require extra scripts, CSS animations are unlikely to slow down your pages.To make a CSS animation, you need three things: an HTML element to animate, a CSS rule which binds the animation to this element, and a group of keyframes that defines the styles at the start and end of the animation. You can also add declarations to further customize your animation"
